# CryptoLance: Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

> "Where Talent Meets Trust—Freelance, Bid, and Get Paid Securely on Chain."

***

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional freelance platforms are centralized, charge high platform fees, and hold user funds, resulting in delays, lack of transparency, and potential censorship. Freelancers and clients deserve direct, auditable, and lightning-fast gig management—without middlemen.

***

## 🎯 Objective

CryptoLance offers a decentralized platform for clients and freelancers to post jobs/gigs, bid using platform tokens, securely escrow budgets, and release milestone-based payments through smart contracts. Our system ensures transparency, instant payouts, and spam-resistant bidding for all users in the global talent economy.
