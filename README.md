# CryptoLance: Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

# Problem Statement  

Traditional freelancing platforms operate in a **centralized** manner, where all interactions—such as posting jobs, submitting proposals, managing payments, and resolving disputes—are controlled by the platform itself. While this model provides structure, it comes with several significant drawbacks:  

## 🔴 Issues with Centralized Freelance Platforms  

1. **High Fees and Hidden Charges**  
   Freelancers and clients are burdened with service fees ranging from 10% to 30% of earnings. These costs cut directly into freelancers’ hard-earned income and increase expenses for clients, making the process less rewarding for both parties.  

2. **Fund Locking and Delays**  
   User payments are often held in escrow or subjected to withdrawal restrictions, leading to long delays before freelancers receive their money. This creates financial stress, especially for individuals who depend on freelancing as their primary income source.  

3. **Lack of Transparency**  
   The centralized nature of these platforms means users have little visibility into how funds are managed, how disputes are resolved, or how algorithms decide which jobs or freelancers are prioritized. This black-box system undermines trust between clients and freelancers.  

4. **Censorship and Control**  
   Since platforms act as gatekeepers, accounts can be suspended or terminated at any time, sometimes without clear justification. This lack of ownership over user identity and work history limits true professional independence.  

5. **Slow and Inefficient Processes**  
   Despite operating in the digital era, payments, verifications, and gig management often involve multiple layers of bureaucracy, slowing down the process of starting, managing, and completing gigs.  

---
## ⚡ The Core Problem  

Freelancers and clients are currently trapped in systems that **diminish autonomy, reduce earnings, and create unnecessary friction**. Centralized platforms act as middlemen, profiting from each interaction while controlling the flow of work and funds. This not only discourages fair participation but also slows down the freelancing ecosystem as a whole.  

To truly empower freelancers and clients, a better model is needed—one that removes unnecessary intermediaries and restores trust, speed, and fairness.  

---

## ✅ What’s Missing Today  

A next-generation freelancing ecosystem should be:  

1. **Fast ⚡ – Instant Payments and Gig Management**  
   Transactions should settle in real-time, allowing freelancers to get paid immediately after completing a gig and clients to confirm work without delays. No more waiting days—or even weeks—for withdrawals.  

2. **Transparent 🔍 – Fully Auditable and Fair Processes**  
   Every action, from proposal creation to payment release, should be verifiable and accessible on a shared ledger. Transparency ensures trust: freelancers know they will be paid, and clients know their funds are secure.  

3. **Decentralized 🌍 – No Single Point of Control or Censorship**  
   Instead of relying on one authority to manage accounts, disputes, or visibility, the system should operate on decentralized infrastructure. This ensures no account can be unfairly blocked, no funds can be frozen, and no single entity controls opportunities.  

4. **Fair 🤝 – Value Stays with Freelancers and Clients**  
   Rather than losing up to 30% of their income to platform fees, freelancers and clients should retain the majority of their value. A fair system means both sides benefit from lower costs, higher trust, and greater autonomy.  

---

⚡ In short: The freelancing world doesn’t need more gatekeepers—it needs a **trustless, efficient, and fair platform** where freelancers and clients can directly collaborate with speed, security, and transparency.

### 5️⃣ Project Kickoff & Milestone Payments  
Freelancers start working once escrow is confirmed. Payments are released in secure milestones:  
- **40%** after first milestone approval  
- **70%** after second milestone approval  
- **100%** on final completion  

<p align="center">
  <img src="./frontend/src/assets/start.png" width="45%" />

</p>  

<p align="center">
  <img src="./frontend/src/assets/secondPay.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="./frontend/src/assets/finalPay.png" width="45%" />
</p>  

---

### 6️⃣ Project Completion or Cancellation  
Once the work is fully completed and approved, the contract releases the final payment.  
In case of cancellation, funds are handled transparently through the smart contract.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="./frontend/src/assets/complete.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="./frontend/src/assets/cancel.png" width="45%" />
</p>

### 7️⃣ Platform Fee  
A minimal **1% fee** is automatically deducted from the project budget and routed to the treasury contract.  
This sustains the platform while keeping costs fair for both freelancers and clients.
